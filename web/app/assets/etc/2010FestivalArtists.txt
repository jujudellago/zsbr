His doctoral thesis discussed the elementary parts of finance, from which various financial analysis can be simply derived. Dr. Brammertz is continually refining and developing this concept while maintaining the foundation laid in his thesis. In 1992, together with Dr. Jürg B. Winter, he founded IRIS integrated risk management ag. At first, he focused on consulting projects in the area of Asset and Liability Management, implementing external systems at several banks. Beginning in 1996, he applied his insights from his doctoral thesis as the Chief Technology Officer by creating riskpro™ which was sold eventually to more than 200 banks in more than 20 countries worldwide. Dr. Brammertz was not only the mind behind the concepts of riskpro™ but also closed most of the deals with the banks.
The success of riskpro™ was based on its clarity of design, consistency and completeness. It covers far ranging topics such as Asset&Liability Management, Value at Risk calculation, Valuation on mark to market basis as well as traditional book keeping and the most advanced IFRS standards, Stress Scenario techniques, Income Simulation and so on. More generally, it is a complete analysis platform for banks and insurances.
In 2008, Iris was sold to FRSGlobal, a leading provider of regulatory reporting in the banking sector. Dr. Brammertz, now an independent consultant, regularly speaks at international conferences on risk management and regulatory compliance and has published numerous articles. In 2009, Wiley & Sons published “Unified Financial Analysis – the missing links of finance” written by Dr. Brammertz and co-authored by distinguished colleagues. The book which is a rewrite of his doctoral thesis outlines the principles behind riskpro™ incorporating his more than twenty years of experience in financial analysis.
Besides being a consultant to banks, insurances and software vendors, Dr. Brammertz main contribution is now in the area of regulation, where the concepts laid down in the book give and important answer for the reestablishment of trust in the financial sector. He is an active member of the Founding Committee for the National Institute of Finance whose proposals have been adopted as part of the Dodd bill which should turn into law by July 4th 2010 and could revolutionize the financial sector.
He also teaches on this subject at the University of Zurich and starting from 2011 also at the ETH Zurich and University of St. Gallen.

These strategies are aimed at transforming management practices so that employees feel more responsible in their work and act accordingly.
In addition to his core business, Christopher co-founded the Zermatt Summit in 2009, an annual event run by the Zermatt Summit Foundation. Held for the first time in 2010, Its role is to inspire, connect and empower high profile entrepreneurs, economists, political and spiritual leaders and NGO representatives who strive to be catalysts of a more inclusive and human globalization. The purpose of the enterprise is not only economic but also social, societal and environmental.
He is also President and co- founder of the <a href="http://www.ecophilos.org/">Ecophilos foundation</a>, a Think Tank which works on the social doctrine of the church applied to businesses. The Foundation organizes a summer school in Fribourg (CH), which annually brings together young professionals, as well as circles of reflection for business leaders.
