He is co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web hosting service he set up in 2004.
In a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Mr. Wales explained his motivations about Wikipedia, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.” The success of the project has helped popularize a trend in web development (called Web 2.0) that aims to facilitate creativity, collaboration, and sharing among users. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Mr. Wales took on the role of the project's spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances. His work with Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, prompted TIME Magazine to name him one of its “100 Most Influential People,” in 2006 in the “Scientists & Thinkers” category. In 2003, Mr. Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge.";s:24:"ArtistProgramDescription";N;s:12:"FestivalYear";s:4:"2011";s:11:"LineupOrder";s:1:"7";s:14:"ArtistIsActive";s:1:"1";s:10:"ArtistBand";s:0:"";s:9:"ArtistFee";N;s:20:"ArtistFeeDescription";N;s:30:"ArtistAccommodationDescription";N;s:12:"ArtistGuests";N;s:27:"ArtistTechnicalRequirements";N;s:23:"ArtistModifiedTimestamp";s:19:"2014-09-19 00:58:58";s:18:"ArtistDoNotPublish";s:1:"0";s:5:"media";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:4:"type";s:5:"image";s:5:"thumb";s:36:"images/artists/jimmy_wales_thumb.jpg";s:7:"resized";s:38:"images/artists/jimmy_wales_278x400.jpg";s:8:"original";s:30:"images/artists/jimmy_wales.jpg";}}s:5:"Shows";a:0:{}}i:86;a:28:{s:8:"ArtistID";s:2:"86";s:14:"ArtistLastName";s:21:"van Golstein Brouwers";s:15:"ArtistFirstName";s:7:"Marilou";s:14:"ArtistFullName";s:29:"Marilou van Golstein Brouwers";s:13:"ArtistWebsite";s:0:"";s:11:"ArtistVideo";s:0:"";s:12:"ArtistExtra1";s:0:"";s:12:"ArtistExtra2";s:0:"";s:12:"ArtistExtra3";s:0:"";s:24:"ArtistDefaultDescription";N;s:28:"ArtistDefaultLongDescription";N;s:31:"ArtistDefaultProgramDescription";N;s:17:"ArtistDescription";s:31:"Managing Director, Triodos Bank";s:21:"ArtistLongDescription";s:1392:"<strong>Marilou van Golstein Brouwers</strong> currently serves as Managing Director of Triodos Investment Management, part of the Triodos Bank Group in the Netherlands.
